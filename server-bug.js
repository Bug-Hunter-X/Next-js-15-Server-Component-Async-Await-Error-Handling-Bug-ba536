In Next.js 15, a subtle bug can occur when using server components with `async/await` and returning data. If an error happens within the `async` function during data fetching, the error might not be properly caught or handled, leading to a silent failure or an unexpected rendering issue.  This is different from client components where errors are typically caught by a try-catch block.  The problem stems from the server component's execution context and how Next.js manages errors in this context.
